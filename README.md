## Overview

The _spotify_ package provides functionality to read image files
and produce plots that simulate spatial omics data
(e.g., 10x Genomics Visium and Xenium).

## Example

Xenium-like                |  Visium-like              
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

_spatalist_ can be easily installed from GitHub using `remotes::install_github()`:
